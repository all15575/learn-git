Learn Git - commonly used commands

Command	Description
git --version	Displays the installed version of Git.
git status	Shows the current status of the working directory and staging area.
git add .	Stages all changes (new, modified, and deleted files) in the current directory.
git commit -m 'your message goes here'	Commits the staged changes with a message provided between the quotes.
.gitignore	A file specifying which files and directories to ignore in a Git repository.
git commit: This command is used to save your changes to the local repository.
-a: This flag tells Git to automatically stage files that have been modified and deleted, but new files you have not told Git about are not affected.
-m 'your message goes here': This flag allows you to include a commit message directly from the command line, without opening an editor.
So, git commit -am 'your message goes here' stages all modified and deleted files, and then commits them with the message you provided. Itâ€™s a convenient way to quickly commit changes without having to manually stage each file.
